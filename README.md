In your project directory, create a file called README.md and in it, answer the following questions:

--What happens when you press the “submit” button? Paste the full URL you are sent to on submit.

After clicking the submit button the url for submitting the form data links the url to a form-handler.
file:///action_page.php?firstname=John&lastname=Doe


--What are the keys of this URL query string? How do they correspond to the “name” fields of your HTML form elements?
The first name and last name are the keys for the URL string above 

--What are the values of the URL query string? How do they correspond to what the user entered or typed?

The values of the URL query string are the users/inputters first and last name. They correspond to what the user used by displaying on the URL's form-handler.
